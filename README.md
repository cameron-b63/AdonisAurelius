# Adonis Aurelius

Adonis Aurelius is a simple mobile app with simple goals. It provides a full-text version of Marcus Aurelius's *Meditations*, a timeless stoic classic.

It also pushes a daily quote from *Meditations* to users, selected at random from the full text.

# How it works

This is a learning project, so the app uses a far larger stack than necessary. A bare-bones version would perform much better, and I'm willing to acknowledge that. The stack is fairly simple nonetheless: react-native on the frontend, and mongodb on the backend.
